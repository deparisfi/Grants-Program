### Project Overview ðŸ“„
### Overview and Project Details
Alphaday is a powerful crypto workflow aggregator that pulls in news, on-chain data, social media, web3 services and much more into one customizable UI
Market research we conducted in 2021 concluded that crypto users are overwhelmed with information and spend a lot of time jumping from one news source to another, from one social site to another, and usually have dozens of tabs open to stay up to date with everything happening in a community. 

Our dashboard aims to provide a single end-point from which users can consume all the information on a project they could possibly want. In this case, we would like to create a Web3 Foundation dashboard that aggregates the following information into a single community dashboard:

- The latest Polkadot / Kusama / Substrate official announcements and blog post content
- A feed of all news mentions for all 3 of those from coindesk, cointelegraph and 20+ other news sources aggregated from across the internet
- A calendar containing all of their events including Governance votes, meetups, hackathons with bounties, AMAs
- Podcast feed containing the latest appearances and interviews given by Polkadot / Kusama / Substrate team members
- Youtube stream containing educational Web3 Foundation content.
- Documentation directories
- Integration with Governance Forums to show the latest and trending discussion topics
- Twitter, Discord, & Telegram Integration to show a feed of latest discussions
- FAQ, Technical Papers, DOT and KSM tokenomics information
- Careers integration to show the latest open jobs listed on all 3 of those 
- On-chain metrics including Addresses with Balance Greater than XXX, Median transaction fee, Transactions Per Second Count, and other metrics
- A widget featuring Roadmaps with all the descriptions and links included.
- Widgets dedicated to PolkaDot and Kusama ecosystem




### Ecosystem Fit
Alphaday builds crypto experience dashboards for enthusiasts, developers, and projects. Users can drag and drop from hundreds of services, news and social feeds, charts, and dapp functionality to create their daily workflows inside a single dashboard. This eliminates the need to have multiple browser tabs open to get different bits of information. i.e. imagine having token prices, gas prices, twitter feed, latest news headlines, TVL, borrowing rates and any other information any user could possibly want all within one single dashboard. 
Weâ€™ve done market research on this and currently peopleâ€™s regular crypto workflows consist of jumping from one browser tab to another to check prices, read news, follow twitter, participate in discussions. A typical crypto user will have 6 to 10 open tabs at any given time and people have referred to Alphaday as the â€˜tab killerâ€™ because all the information youâ€™d need across all your different tabs is available in Alphaday. In this sense, we do not have any direct competitor that can provide 50 different types of services and functionality within one dashboard.

Iâ€™ve been involved in the Ethereum space since early 2016 and joined Kyber Network in 2017 as Head of Ecosystem Growth before quitting to start Alphaday full-time in 2021. Previously I worked at Thomson Reuters for a decade building financial products that rivaled the Bloomberg Terminal. I am currently also a Venture Partner at IOSG.VC

My co-founder Felipe has also been involved in Ethereum since 2016 and was a Developer Advocate at Pegasys and Consensys before quitting to work full time on Alphaday.

Alphadayâ€™s third co-founder is DeFiDude who used to be a community manager at both Aave and Kyber Network before co-founding Alphaday.

### Development Status ðŸ“–

Product Code:
Live product (Beta): https://app.alphaday.com/ 
Github: https://github.com/AlphadayHQ
Weâ€™ve open sourced a number of widgets (ie. portfolio widget) and weâ€™re in the process of open-sourcing more of our code as well as a list of all the data sources we use. There are components we canâ€™t open source because we used off-the-shelf third party libraries and we couldnâ€™t get permission to open source.
Research:
Weâ€™ve conducted interview-based market research on users and currently peopleâ€™s regular crypto workflows consist of jumping from one browser tab to another to check prices, read news, follow twitter, participate in discussions. A typical crypto user will have 6 to 10 open tabs at any given time and people have referred to Alphaday as the â€˜tab killerâ€™ because all the information youâ€™d need across all your different tabs is available in Alphaday. In this sense, we do not have any direct competitor that can provide 50 different types of services and functionality within one dashboard.


Note that besides maintaining your dashboard, we will be constantly working on developing and improving our appâ€™s features and functionality. These new updates will also apply to your dashboard by default as we progress.


### Development Roadmap and Overview
2,000 USD upfront costs for development including integrating the discussion forums, blog post, social feed, jobs listing and on-chain metrics.

250 USD per month for 12 months for maintenance including having an Alphaday content analyst quality-checking the dashboard every day and ensuring the Calendar widget is up-to-date with latest events, all news mentions across the internet are captured by the dashboard, any updates not automatically captured by the Alphaday aggregator engine is manually added to the board, and other maintenance tasks.

Total Budget Requested: 5,000 USD.


Milestone 1 â€” Dashboard Deployment
Estimated duration: 2 months
FTE: 1
Costs: 2,000 USD
Milestone 2 â€” Maintenance
Estimated Duration: 12 months
FTE: 1
Costs: 250 USD per month
Future Plans
Please include here
Once weâ€™ve launched the board, we will do user interviews and feedback sessions to tune the dashboard. We will continue this process of iterating, deploying, and collecting feedback continuously to build a dashboard that PolkaDot / Kusama / Substrate stakeholders truly love to use.

A month ago we started reaching out to a select group of projects to pitch our Ecosystem Board idea and within this first month weâ€™ve had buy-in from Aave, Dfinity (ICP), Zcash, Aztec, theGraph, Sia, Impossible Finance and a few other projects and weâ€™ll be releasing dashboards for their communities throughout February, and March.
